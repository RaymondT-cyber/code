Pride of Code - Modular Refactor (scaffold)
==========================================
Files created under: /mnt/data/pride_of_code_modular

How to run:
  1. Ensure pygame is installed in your environment.
     pip install pygame
  2. Run:
     python3 core/main.py

Notes:
- This is a scaffolded refactor. It provides module boundaries and runnable examples
  (particle system as sprites, band member sprites, simplified editor).
- Next steps: iteratively extract more functions from your original /mnt/data/pride_of_code.py
  into the relevant modules (levels, ui, more entities).
